<h1>Ami Shah</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Ami Shah and I am 16 years old. I attend Dougherty Valley High School and about to enter my senior year. My family consists of me, my parents, and my sister, Aashka, who just graduated high school. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer both competitively and on the high school team. I have been playing since I was 5 and don't plan to stop anytime soon. Not only do I love soccer, but also going to the beach, swimming, and going on adventures. </p>
